# Part 3
## Welcome to Section 3

In this section we will extend our network configuration with a new Organzation Owner-Org, who only wished to create credentails after the artist and brokerage had processed the workflow volume to nessisitate its demand.

the top of our ```env.sh``` file file has a path requirement to a file containing the fabric binaries cryptogen and configtxgen

``` chmod 777 ./bootstrap-extension.sh ```

``` ./bootstrap-extension.sh ```

this will automate our part-2 process to after it is spun up
happy tour :)

Extending our network with Kafka


``` cd basic-network-kafka ```
./start.sh needs the path variable on line 3 to lead to the fabric binaries
```sudo chmod 777 -R ./artifacts```
``` ./start.sh ```
